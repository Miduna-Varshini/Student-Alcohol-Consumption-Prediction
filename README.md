# Student-Alcohol-Consumption-Prediction
Student Alcohol Consumption Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts the level of alcohol consumption among students based on academic, social, and personal factors using a Machine Learning model. The model analyzes historical student data to identify patterns that influence alcohol consumption behavior.

The trained model is saved as a pickle (.pkl) file and deployed using a Streamlit web application for easy interaction. This project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and deployment, and is developed mainly for educational and learning purposes.
